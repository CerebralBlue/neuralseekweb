# Welcome to NeuralSeek Web Docs

## Testing the pages locally
1. Install jekyll in your local environment: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. run `jekyll serve` to run a jekyll server.
3. open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000` (or follow the instruction on jekyll server's output message which should contain the URL.)

## Testing the pages in docker
If you have docker desktop installed in your local environment, you can follow this steps to run it.
1. cd ./docker
2. ./run.sh

> Note: When working with the documents, make sure you are changing and pushing anything into `publish` branch, as that branch is reserved only for publishing to the public website. If you are making any changes, best recommended to create your own branch and work there, and later create PR into `main` branch.
