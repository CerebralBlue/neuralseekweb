# WebHook

You can integrate NeuralSeek with applications that knows how to send WebHooks to it.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that NeuralSeek response times are highly dependent on the KnowledgeBase used. You can check the response time from your KnowledgeBase on the "configure" tab, to see how fast your KnowledgeBase is returning its results. Ensure your consuming platform is configured to handle a longer timeout if your KnowledgeBase response time is over 1 second. You may call the WebHook endpoint from any applications like chatbots or customer-facing UIs, etc.
