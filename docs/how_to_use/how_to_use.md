## Use Cases

### Virtual Agent/Chatbot

NeuralSeek can integrate with Virtual Agents/Chatbots such as IBM Watson Assistant or AWS Lex to provide a tool to automate and improve the customer care process. NeuralSeek can allow Virtual Agents to handle a customer care process, only delegating to a Live Agent if necessary. NeuralSeek with a virtual agent can be used as an internal tool as well to provide a corporate KnowledgeBase-backed solution to assist teams in decision making.

### Internal Organization Tool

NeuralSeek can be used as an internal organization tool for companies with large amounts of data/documentation to sort through. Through the “Seek”, “Curate”, and “Analytics” section, NeuralSeek allows a company to share information from a virtual agent to an employee/user without delegating to live agents in the business. NeuralSeek provides managers a solution to aid their employees when they feel as though they don’t have the bandwidth to support large & vastly unique demographics. It maintains conversational context to provide users with concrete answers to each and every question that they present to the virtual agent.
