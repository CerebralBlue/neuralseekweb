# Content Analytics

## What is it?

Two main scores are returned when a user asks a question to NeuralSeek:

**Coverage Score:** This score represents the number of documents or sections of documents that discuss the subject area(s) of a question from NeuralSeek.

**Confidence Score:** The confidence score represents the likelihood that the information found in the KnowledgeBase of NeuralSeek and presented as a response is correct. This probability is given as a percentage.
