# Training Virtual Agents

## What is it?
NeuralSeek is directly trained off of the documentation loaded into the KnowledgeBase. If there is undesired output from NeuralSeek, the first step is to review the documentation within the KnowledgeBase. There are many features available to tackle challenges users may face as their solution develops.

NeuralSeek goes beyond just generating responses; it automatically builds and maintains a virtual agent for users as well.

## Why is it important?
One of the key factors in reducing costs is the utilization of curated answers sourced from a pool of responses, which proves to be more economical. Also, when the collection of answers becomes stagnant, potentially leading to outdated information, this feature will be able to detect it and refresh those with less manual process.

## How does it work?
To tackle this challenge, NeuralSeek provides a solution by automatically monitoring the sources of information. It continuously tracks and compares the generated responses with the source documents to determine if any changes have occurred. By doing so, NeuralSeek ensures that the answers remain up-to-date and relevant. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and the potential for outdated information, allowing users to trust the accuracy and currency of the answers provided.
