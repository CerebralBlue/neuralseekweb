# Curation Of Answers

## What is it?
NeuralSeek will automatically generate IBM Watson Assistant “Actions” or “Dialogs,” based on user questions that are asked. Generally, IBM Watson Assistant needs five (5) or more user question examples to train on for a high confidence match to a user query. When user questions are cataloged by the system, NeuralSeek automatically tries to generate similar worded questions to meet the minimum of five (5) user examples. Similar Question generation may take up to one (1) minute to show inside the Curate tab after a new user question is logged.
