# Conversational Context

## What is it?
NeuralSeek maintains context during each user interaction (conversation). When initiating a conversation, a session token is generated. Using this token and several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, NeuralSeek tracks the topic of conversation to keep interactions focused and structured, allowing it to follow-up on questions that do not directly refer to the topic. In addition, these NLP models enable NeuralSeek to filter corporate knowledge topically by date to ensure that the information being returned is focused on the time period of the question.
