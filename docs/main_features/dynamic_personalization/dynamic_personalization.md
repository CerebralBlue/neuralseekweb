# Dynamic Personalization

## What is it?
One way NeuralSeek quickly ties into the users business is by automatically personalizing results based on information from their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. By analyzing user data such as past interactions, preferences, purchase history, and demographic information, NeuralSeek can dynamically adjust its outputs to match the specific needs and preferences of each individual user.

## Why is it important?

## How does it work?
This can be previewed in the “Seek” tab of the NeuralSeek UI, and in production environments users will pass the personalization details via our API as the REST call to when /seek is made.
