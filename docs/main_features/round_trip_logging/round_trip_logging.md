# Round Trip Logging

## What is it?
Round-trip logging is a process that involves recording and storing all interactions between a user and a Virtual Agent. NeuralSeek supports receiving logs from Virtual Agents in order to monitor curated responses. This includes the user’s question, the Virtual Agent’s response, and any follow-up questions or clarifications.

## Why is it important?
The purpose of round-trip logging is to improve the Virtual Agent’s performance by analyzing the data and identifying areas for improvement.
