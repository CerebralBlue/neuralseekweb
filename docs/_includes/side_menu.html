  side_menu.html:

  This template initializes the side menu by:
  1. Fetching all pages that have a "parent" attribute set to "root".
  2. Sorting these pages based on their "order" attribute.
  3. Passing the sorted list of root pages to the `render_pages.html` include file, 
     which is responsible for rendering each page and its sub-pages (if any) recursively.
