![seek_updated](images/seek_updated.png)

Users can test questions and answers in the “Seek” section, as well as change the language/utilize the Match Input Feature, and see where their answers are coming from within their KnowledgeBase.

User ID: Users are able to view and set a User ID to test conversations. 

Session ID: A unique "Session ID" number is generated. Users are able to revert to a new session with a unique "Session ID" number by clicking the red arrow next to "Session Turns".  

Session Turns: A "Session Turns" number is generated, which allow the user to view how many turns were generated in the corresponding Session ID. 

Highlight Answer Provenance: Enabling this feature reveals how the majority of responses are formed by the trained answer and additional components that came in from the KnowledgeBase itself. Users are able to enable or disable.

Answer Streaming: Streaming is available to enable or disable. Enabling this feature allows for the reponse to be generated word-by-word. Disabling this feature allows for the whole response to be generated at once. 

Users are able to provide feedback on answers by clicking the "Thumbs Up" or "Thumbs Down" icons. 

Users can personalize and filter through their KnowledgeBase documents on the Seek tab as well.
